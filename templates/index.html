            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Academic achievements are scattered everywhere — certificates in folders, emails buried in inboxes,
                    paper records collecting dust. Students struggle to showcase their accomplishments during placements
                    or applications. Teachers waste time managing spreadsheets and physical documents. Nobody has a
                    clear, organized view of what students have actually achieved.</p>
                <p>Our Achievement Management System centralizes everything. Students see all their achievements in one
                    dashboard with analytics. Teachers input achievements through simple forms with auto-complete. The
                    system tracks hackathons, coding competitions, paper presentations, conferences, and symposiums —
                    complete with certificates, dates, positions, and detailed descriptions. Clean, fast, and organized.
